Two takeaways from my first few classes at Turing:

1. Time management is extremely important to success at Turing and the grownup job world.

2. I need to put extra effort into learning to collaborate and communicate through zoom, I find it intimidating.  

Two strategies I'm committed to trying during the rest of Mod 0:

1. Allowing myself time to understand the concepts, before immediately beating myself up.

2. Implementing my calendar to take away the stress of deciding "what I have to do right now."

Shoutout:

To my entire family, they have gone above and beyond to make sure as many of my responsibilities as possible are taken off my hands, so that I can concentrate on my studies.
